# Security Policy

Most hosted content does not constitute a in-depth security policy.\
However both [ACPROX](https://github.com/kiyarose/acprox) and [EZPROX](https://github.com/kiyarose/ezprox) have their own versions of this policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

AC/EZprox use [UltraViolet](https://github.com/titaniumnetwork-dev/Ultraviolet) and as such, general security concerns should be flagged there.\
However, if you believe the issue is on our side and should be reported here, you have two options. <br><br>

> If the issue is non sensitive. A [normal bug request](https://github.com/kiyarose/SillyLittleFiles/issues/new/choose) can be filed. <br><br>
> If the issue is sensitive email
